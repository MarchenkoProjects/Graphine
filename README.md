# Graphine

---

**Graphine** is a *Java framework* that provides an Object/Relational Mapping (**ORM**) 
implementation by generating native human-readable JDBC code.

Graphine does not support *lazy loading*, *caching*, *dirty checking* and other advanced *JPA features*.
It focuses on high-level [DDD concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design#Building_blocks) and 
generates low-level JDBC code from them.

## Features

- Simplified entity markup;
- Spring-Data style repositories;
- Native JDBC code generation;
- Human-readable generated source code;
- NO reflection.
